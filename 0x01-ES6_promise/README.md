# ES6 Promises

In JavaScript, a Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It allows you to handle asynchronous operations more easily and cleanly, especially when dealing with multiple asynchronous tasks or chaining them together. 
 
## A Promise can be in one of three states:

    - Pending: Initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected. 
    - Fulfilled (resolved): The operation completed successfully. 
    - Rejected: The operation failed or encountered an error.
